"""Path resolution across the T096 canon relocation.

T096 moved the kit's canon out of the Claude-branded directory:

    .claude/skills/  ->  skills/
    .claude/agents/  ->  agents/

`.claude/skills` and `.claude/agents` remain as committed relative symlinks so
Claude Code still discovers them, but the *tracked* path is now the plain-root
one.

Several suites byte-pin a file against a historical baseline ref via
``git show <ref>:<path>``. Those refs predate the move, so the file exists there
under its old `.claude/`-prefixed path and `git show` fails on the new one. The
`git mv` preserved history, so the content is reachable — only the name changed.

`read_at` asks for the current path first and falls back to the pre-move path
when the ref is older than the move. It deliberately does not hard-code the move
commit: ancestry checks would break the moment the branch is rebased, whereas
"does this path exist at that ref" is true regardless of how history is reshaped.
