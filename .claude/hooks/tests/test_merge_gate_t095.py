"""T095 — the merge gate's three defects, one file.

  * **Defect A** — `has_filled_verify_row()` resolved the Evidence section under
    the *main checkout's* `tasks/` only, but Stage 3 writes
    `TASK_REVIEW_Txxx.md` in the agent's worktree, on the task branch. Every
    worktree-isolated task therefore read as `(no evidence row)`.
  * **Defect B** — the block message and the quoted-invocation comment both
    prescribed `CLAUDE_ACTIVE_TASK=Txxx <command>`, which T047 measured as
    non-functional (a hook is a *sibling* process of the tool call).
  * **Defect C** — the gate classified a command by its **data**: a `cat > file`
    heredoc whose body contained `git push` was blocked as a push.

Every fixture here is **constructed**. Nothing reads the live board, the live
`tasks/` directory, or the machine's real `git worktree list` — a test that did
would pass or fail depending on which worktrees happen to exist today.
