"""T096 AC11/AC12 — `.claude/{skills,agents}` are relative symlinks onto the plain-root canon.

T096 moved the canon to `skills/` and `agents/` and left `.claude/skills` and `.claude/agents`
behind as committed relative symlinks. Claude Code only discovers skills and agent guides under
`.claude/`, so those two links are the sole thing making this repo able to run its own skills.

They are also the easiest thing in the tree to destroy by accident. A reader seeing `skills/` in a
diff can mistake `.claude/skills` for a stale duplicate and delete it; a well-meaning "fix" can
replace a link with a copy, and the copy then silently rots out of sync with the canon; a Windows
checkout or an over-eager archive tool can materialise the link as a real directory.

None of those show up as a test failure anywhere else in this suite — the rest of the suite reads
files through paths that resolve either way. That is the gap these tests close:

* AC12 — the links exist, are symlinks, resolve, and are **relative**. An absolute target is a
  correctness bug, not a style choice: every sub-agent works in a `git worktree`, and a baked
  absolute path either is missing there or points back into the main checkout, letting an agent
  read canon from outside its own isolation boundary.
* AC11 — anti-vacuity. Deleting `.claude/skills` must turn this suite RED. The mutation controls
  below prove these assertions actually fire instead of passing on a tree where nothing is there.
